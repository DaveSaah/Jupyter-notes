    "- HTML works by surrounding text and graphics content appearing on the page with special codes instructing the browser on how to arrange and display this content.\n",
    "- Markup codes, also called html tags or elements, are always enclosed inside \"<\" and \">\" symbols to set them apart from the text content to which they apply.\n",
    "- Normally, an \"opening\" tag indicates the beginning form of formatting( e.g. ```<h2>```) an a separate \"closing\" tag indicates the ending point of formatting (e.g. ```</h2>```) <br/><br/>\n",
